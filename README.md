# Triangle_Analysis v1.1
Calculate incenter (and inradius), circumcenter (and circumradius), orthocenter and centroid of a triangle when a given triangle is entered interms of its vertices.

## Function
It generates a graphical representation of the triangle along with the centers and circles required to be found in the X-Y plane. Also two or more triangles can be studied at the same time by default. Option given for clearing the graphical section and study different triangles one after another.

## Opportunities
1. Simple matlab code can be found in mfiles. Triangle.m code gets the results.
2. Matlab App(.mlappinstall) and Standalone App(.exe) both are provided to be used by users respectively who have Matlab installed in their systems and who don't. In the App, triangle vertices are input using GUI and results are output in the same interface along with the graphical representation.
3. Source code for the matlab app can be found in (.mlapp) file for further modification and packaging as required.
4. Web App(.ctf) is also created so that the app can be hosted in a close internet environment among different users in any platform via Matlab Web App Server.
